<p>This extension generates various Java serialized payloads designed to execute 
OS commands. There are three ways to use the extension:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Generate a payload from the YSOSERIAL Tab. You can then copy and paste 
	it into other tabs in Burp.<br><br></li>
	<li>Generate a payload from the YSOSERIAL Tab. In another tab you can select 
	the text you want to replace and right click. You have three encoding 
	options:<br><br><ul>
		<li>Raw - This will replace your selected text with a raw unencoded 
		version of the payload. </li>
		<li>B64 - This will replace your selected text with a Base64 encoded 
		version. </li>
		<li>URLEnc - This will replace your selected text with a URL-encoded and 
		base64 encoded payload.<br><br></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You can use inline commands to replace your text with a payload that 
	contains your command. For example you can enter text in Repeater like: <br>
	<br>$(CC1|ping -c1 8.8.8.8) <br><br>Select the above text and right click 
	any of the Java Serialized Payload Options and it will replace your command 
	with a payload containing that command. <br><br>The first parameter before 
	the pipe in the above statement is the version of the exploit. You can enter 
	any of the following: <br> <br>
	<ul>
		<li>CC1 or CollectionCommons1 </li>
		<li>CC2 or CollectionCommons2 </li>
		<li>GV1 or Groovy1 </li>
		<li>SP1 or Spring1 </li>
	</ul>
	<br>TThe second parameter is the OS command you wish to run. </li>
</ul>
